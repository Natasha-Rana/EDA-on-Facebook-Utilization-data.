This project was created as a part of INSAID Capstone to discover and analyze a pattern in the way people use Facebook based on their gender and age-groups.  

Detecting this pattern can help the company to understand the needs of its target market and develop a more refined version of its application catering to the exclusive needs of its users. Overall, this will help Facebook to enhance its user experience(UX) to the fullest. 

The data was sourced from an open-source(csv file) containing records of Facebook users, their age, date of birth(year, month, day), gender, tenure on Facebook, number of posts liked(through mobile and web devices), number of likes received(through mobile and web devices) by the users,  friend count of the users, and friendships initiated by them.

By the end of this project, we will get our most active and least actives users on Facebook. This will help the company to devise appropriate marketing strategies based on the usage pattern of the users.
